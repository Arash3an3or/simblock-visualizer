## Usage

This visualizer is available from:
- https://dsg-titech.github.io/simblock-visualizer/

You can see the visualization by uploading `output.json` via the UPLOAD button.
- `output.json`, one of the SimBlock's output files, is listing occurred events during a simulation.
- If no files have been uploaded yet, this visualizer displays the visualization for the default output file as a demonstration.
- Note: This visualizer supports only the default setting for a list of regions â€• `BlockChainSimulator.settings.NetworkConfiguration#REGION_LIST`.

The correspondence of each visible object is as follows:
- Circle: a blockchain node.
    - The coordinates (latitude and longitude) are randomly determined around the region of the node.
    - The color is associated with the latest block of the node.
- Large circle: a miner of the block corresponding to the color.
- Edge: a propagation from a node to another node at the timestamp.
